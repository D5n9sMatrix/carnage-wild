Software Installation Microsoft about Mavel in form vscode

Software installation refers to the large scale distribution of software and application on an organizational level. Administrators are frequently bombarded with numerous software installation requests, and have to validate those requests individually and authorize the software installation. Traditionally, a software is placed in a Network Share and the end users can install the software manually. As organizations are ever-expanding, this method soon becomes unsustainable. This is where software installation tools come in handy.
What is software installation?

A well-designed software installation tool can pragmatically address the growing number of requests through an automated software installation tool. The software deployment module equips you with easy-to-use and user-friendly tool that provides effortless automated software installation in Windows, Mac and Linux environment. This is extremely advantageous considering the amount of time and energy saved on large-scale deployments of numerous software. Furthermore, all this can be done from a central location.

How can I uninstall the previous version of software and install the latest version?

This is a scenario often faced by administrators. The older version of software prevents the installation of the new version of the software. You can check whether a software has already been installed on a computer and if so, uninstall the previous version of that particular software before installing the new software version. Steps:

    Add software package
        Open the Software Deployment tab, and click Add Packages.
    Select: Uninstall Software
        Under Pre-Deployment Activites, choose Uninstall Software and enter the version number of the software here.

    Add Software Package
        Open the Software Deployment tab, and click Add Packages.
    Select: Check Software
        Under Pre-Deployment Activites, choose Check Software and enter the software name.

After including the Check Software Pre-Deployment Activity in the software package, the software installation will be skipped for those computers that already have the software.

How to automate software installation?

While defining the software configuration, users can choose the target and the applicable deployment policy.

    Deployment Policy

How can I handle open-source software installation requests?

Administrators are bombarded with open-source software installation requests. In order to reduce the frequency of these requests, we let you configure the Self Service Portal. As the very name implies, the end users can open the portal and install the software when required.

    For administrators:
        Navigate to: Software Deployment->Deployment->Self Service Portal.
        Add Software Packages Drag and drop the open-source software packages that end users frequently request.
        Define the Target.
    For end users:
        Agent Tray Right click the agent tray icon.
        Choose Self Service Portal.
        Choose the preferred software and click Install.

Additionally, users can directly raise software installation requests through the Self Service Portal for licensed software.
